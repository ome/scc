## Getting Started

Under Python 2.7, the only requirement is [PyGithub](https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub).

    $ pip install pygithub

For Python 2.6, you will also need to install [argparse](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse)

    $ pip install argparse

With that, it's possible to execute scc:

    $ python scc.py


## Brew installation

To install the latest release of scc under [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/), use brew install:

    $ brew install scc
